**DSA Solution Repository**
This repository contains my daily practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The solutions are primarily written in [Your Programming Language, e.g., Python, C++, Java] and cover a variety of fundamental topics to enhance my problem-solving skills and understanding of core computer science concepts.

**Topics Covered**
The solutions are organized by data structure or algorithmic technique.

Arrays & Strings: Problems involving manipulating arrays and strings.

Linked Lists: Solutions for singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.

Trees & Graphs: Problems on binary trees, BSTs, and graph traversals (BFS, DFS).

Dynamic Programming (DP): Solutions for problems solved using DP, including memoization and tabulation.

Greedy Algorithms: Solutions for problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution.

Searching & Sorting: Implementations of various search and sort algorithms, as well as problems where these techniques are applied.

**How to Use This Repository**
Feel free to browse the code, use it for reference, or suggest improvements.

**Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

**Navigate to a topic folder:**

cd your-repo-name/arrays

**View the solution:** Each problem is typically in its own file named after the problem (e.g., two_sum.py). The file will include the problem description in comments.

**Contribution**
This is a personal practice repository. However, if you find any bugs or have a better solution, you can open an issue or submit a pull request. All constructive feedback is welcome.
